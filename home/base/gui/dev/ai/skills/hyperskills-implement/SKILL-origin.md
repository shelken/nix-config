# Implementation

Verification-driven coding with tight feedback loops. Distilled from 21,321 tracked operations
across 64+ projects, 612 debugging sessions, and 2,476 conversation histories. These are the
patterns that consistently ship working code.

**Core insight:** 2-3 edits then verify. 73% of fixes go unverified — that's the #1 quality gap. The
difference between a clean session and a debugging spiral is verification cadence.

## The Sequence

Every implementation follows the same macro-sequence, regardless of scale:

```dot
digraph implement {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];

    "ORIENT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];
    "PLAN" [style=filled, fillcolor="#fff8e0"];
    "IMPLEMENT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#ffe8e8"];
    "VERIFY" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8ffe8"];
    "COMMIT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];

    "ORIENT" -> "PLAN";
    "PLAN" -> "IMPLEMENT";
    "IMPLEMENT" -> "VERIFY";
    "VERIFY" -> "IMPLEMENT" [label="fix", style=dashed];
    "VERIFY" -> "COMMIT" [label="pass"];
    "COMMIT" -> "IMPLEMENT" [label="next chunk", style=dashed];
}
```

**ORIENT** — Read existing code before touching anything. `Grep -> Read -> Read` is the dominant
opening. Sessions that read 10+ files before the first edit require fewer fix iterations. Never
start with blind changes.

**PLAN** — Scale-dependent (see below). Skip for trivial fixes, write a task list for features, run
a research swarm for epics.

**IMPLEMENT** — Work in batches of 2-3 edits, then verify. Follow the dependency chain. Edit
existing files 9:1 over creating new ones. Fix errors immediately — don't accumulate them.

**VERIFY** — Typecheck is the primary gate. Run it after every 2-3 edits. Run tests after
feature-complete. Run the full suite before commit.

**COMMIT** — Atomic chunks, committed as you go. Verify, stage specific files, commit, then loop
back to the next chunk. Many small commits per session is the norm. See **Commit Cadence** below for
message anatomy.

## Code Discipline

Behavioral lens that governs every phase of the loop. Adapted from Karpathy's
[observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls — models
"make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking ... they really
like to overcomplicate code and APIs, bloat abstractions ... implement a bloated construction over
1000 lines when 100 would do."

These principles bias toward caution over speed. For trivial fixes, use judgment.

### Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

| Situation                               | Action                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Multiple interpretations of the request | Present them; don't pick silently |
| A simpler approach is plausible         | Say so; push back when warranted  |
| Something is unclear                    | Stop; name what's confusing; ask  |
| You hold a load-bearing assumption      | State it explicitly               |
| Inconsistency between request and code  | Surface it before proceeding      |

ORIENT (read the code) is the prerequisite. This principle is what to do with what you find: name
the gaps, don't paper over them.

### Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

| Don't                                          | Do                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Add features beyond what was asked             | Solve exactly the stated problem             |
| Build abstractions for single-use code         | Inline first; abstract when reused           |
| Add "flexibility" or configurability not asked | Hardcode now; parameterize on demand         |
| Handle errors for impossible scenarios         | Trust internal invariants; validate at edges |
| Write 200 lines when 50 would do               | Rewrite tighter                              |

The test: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

| Rule                                                   | Why                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting | Pollutes the diff; outside your scope           |
| Don't refactor code that isn't broken                  | Scope creep expands blast radius                |
| Match existing style even if you'd do it differently   | Local consistency beats your preferences        |
| Notice unrelated dead code → mention, don't delete     | Other branches/agents may rely on it            |
| Remove imports/vars/funcs _your_ changes orphaned      | Clean up after yourself                         |
| Leave pre-existing dead code alone                     | Outside your remit unless explicitly asked      |
| Don't touch comments you don't understand              | Karpathy: "side effects ... orthogonal to task" |

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-driven execution

Define verifiable success. Loop until it passes.

| Vague task       | Verifiable goal                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "Add validation" | Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass  |
| "Fix the bug"    | Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass   |
| "Refactor X"     | Ensure the same tests pass before and after          |
| "Make it work"   | Reject — name the actual signal that proves it works |

For multi-step work, state the plan with verification per step:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria require constant clarification.

## Scale Selection

Strategy changes dramatically based on scope. Pick the right weight class:

| Scale                      | Edits   | Strategy                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial** (config, typo) | 1-5     | Read -> Edit -> Verify -> Commit                         |
| **Small fix**              | 5-20    | Grep error -> Read -> Fix -> Test -> Commit              |
| **Feature**                | 50-200  | Plan -> Layer-by-layer impl -> Verify per layer          |
| **Subsystem**              | 300-500 | Task planning -> Wave dispatch -> Layer-by-layer         |
| **Epic**                   | 1000+   | Research swarm -> Spec -> Parallel agents -> Integration |

**Skip planning when:** Scope is clear, single-file change, fix describable in one sentence.

**Plan when:** Multiple files, unfamiliar code, uncertain approach.

---

## Dependency Chain

Build things in this order. Validated across fullstack, Rust, and monorepo projects:

```
Types/Models -> Backend Logic -> API Routes -> Frontend Types -> Hooks/Client -> UI Components -> Tests
```

**Fullstack (Python + TypeScript):**

1. Database model + migration
2. Service/business logic layer
3. API routes (FastAPI or tRPC)
4. Frontend API client
5. React hooks wrapping API calls
6. UI components consuming hooks
7. Lint -> typecheck -> test -> commit

**Rust:**

1. Error types (`thiserror` enum with `#[from]`)
2. Type definitions (structs, enums)
3. Core logic (`impl` blocks)
4. Module wiring (`mod.rs` re-exports)
5. `cargo check` -> `cargo clippy` -> `cargo test`

**Key finding:** Database migrations are written AFTER the code that needs them. Frontend drives
backend changes as often as the reverse.

---

## Verification Cadence

The single most impactful practice. Get this right and everything else follows.

| Gate                   | When                       | Speed               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Typecheck**          | After every 2-3 edits      | Fast (primary gate) |
| **Lint (autofix)**     | After implementation batch | Fast                |
| **Tests (specific)**   | After feature complete     | Medium              |
| **Tests (full suite)** | Before commit              | Slow                |
| **Build**              | Before PR/deploy only      | Slowest             |

### The Edit-Verify-Fix Cycle

The sweet spot: **3 changes -> verify -> 1 fix**. This is the most common successful pattern.

The expensive pattern: **2 changes -> typecheck -> 15 fixes** (type cascade). Prevent by grepping
all consumers before modifying shared types.

**Combined gates save time:** `turbo lint:fix typecheck --filter=pkg` runs both in one shot. Scope
verification to affected packages, never the full monorepo.

**Practical tips:**

- Run `lint:fix` BEFORE `lint` check to reduce iterations
- `cargo check` over `cargo build` (2-3x faster, same error detection)
- Truncate verbose output: `2>&1 | tail -20`
- Wrap tests with timeout: `timeout 120 uv run pytest`

## Decision Trees

### Read vs Edit

```
Familiar file you edited this session?
  Yes -> Edit directly (verify after)
  No  -> Read it this session?
    Yes -> Edit
    No  -> Read first (79% of quick fixes start with reading)
```

### Subagents vs Direct Work

```
Self-contained with a clear deliverable?
  Yes -> Produces verbose output (tests, logs, research)?
    Yes -> Subagent (keeps context clean)
    No  -> Need frequent back-and-forth?
      Yes -> Direct
      No  -> Subagent
  No -> Direct (iterative refinement needs shared context)
```

### Refactoring Approach

```
Can changes be made incrementally?
  Yes -> Move first, THEN consolidate (separate commits)
        New code alongside old, remove old only after tests pass
  No  -> Analysis phase first (parallel review agents)
        Gap analysis: old vs new function-by-function
        Implement gaps as focused tasks
```

### Bug Fix vs Feature vs Refactor

| Type         | Cadence                                                                  | Typical Cycles |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Bug fix**  | Grep error -> Read 2-5 files -> Edit 1-3 files -> Test -> Commit         | 1-2            |
| **Feature**  | Plan -> Models -> API -> Frontend -> Test -> Commit                      | 5-15           |
| **Refactor** | Audit -> Gap analysis -> Incremental migration -> Verify parity          | 10-30+         |
| **Upgrade**  | Research changelog -> Identify breaking changes -> Bump -> Fix consumers | Variable       |

---

## Error Recovery

**65% of debugging sessions resolve in 1-2 iterations.** The remaining 35% risk spiraling into 6+
iterations.

### Quick Resolution (Do This)

1. Read relevant code first (79% success correlation)
2. Form explicit hypothesis: "The issue is X because Y"
3. Make ONE targeted fix
4. Verify the fix worked

### Spiral Prevention (Avoid This)

1. **Separate error domains** — fix ALL type errors first, THEN test failures. Never interleave.
2. **3-strike rule** — after 3 failed attempts on same error: change approach entirely, or escalate.
3. **Cascade depth > 3** — pause, enumerate ALL remaining issues, fix in dependency order.
4. **Context rot** — after ~15-20 iterations, `/clear` and start fresh. A clean session with a
   better prompt beats accumulated corrections every time.

### The Two-Correction Rule

If you've corrected the same issue twice, `/clear` and restart. Accumulated context noise defeats
accuracy.

---

## Commit Cadence

Commit as you go. Each commit captures one logical chunk that has been built, verified, and tested.
Many small commits per session is the norm — never accumulate hours of unrelated work into a single
mega-commit. The COMMIT step in the macro-sequence loops back to IMPLEMENT for the next chunk; that
loop is the rhythm.

### When to commit

| Trigger                                          | Action          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Logical chunk done and verification passes       | Commit now      |
| Move/rename complete (before behavioral changes) | Commit (move)   |
| Behavioral change works (after the move commit)  | Commit (change) |
| Refactor extracted, callers still pass           | Commit          |
| Test added that exercises a fixed bug            | Commit          |
| About to switch to a different concern           | Commit current  |
| Verification fails mid-chunk                     | Don't commit    |
| Speculative or exploratory edits                 | Don't commit    |

Rule of thumb: if a reviewer would want to read it as a separate diff, it's a separate commit.

### Local style first

Before the first commit in any repo, detect the local style. Repos have personalities — your commits
should match.

```bash
git log -10 --oneline
```

Observe the actual patterns and mirror them:

| Pattern              | Example                        | Mirror               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Conventional Commits | `feat(api): add token refresh` | `type(scope): msg`   |
| Gitmoji              | `✨ Add token refresh`         | Leading emoji + msg  |
| Ticket prefix        | `[ENG-1234] Add token refresh` | Mirror bracket style |
| Module prefix        | `auth: add token refresh`      | Mirror separator     |
| Plain                | `Add token refresh`            | No prefix, plain     |

**Mirror format, NOT quality.** If existing commits are terse one-liners, you still write a
descriptive subject and body — you're elevating the standard, not lowering yours to match. If no
clear pattern exists, default to Conventional Commits.

### Conventional Commits (default)

Format: `type(scope): subject`. Scope is optional but encouraged when the change is localized.

| Type       | When                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New user-facing capability               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                  |
| `refactor` | Restructure without behavior change      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                  |
| `test`     | Add/update tests only                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                       |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |
| `chore`    | Tooling, deps, housekeeping              |
| `build`    | Build system, packaging                  |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration                      |

### Message anatomy

**Subject line:**

| Rule                     | Why                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imperative mood          | "Add token refresh", not "Added" or "Adds"                 |
| ≤72 characters           | Renders cleanly in `git log --oneline` and PR lists        |
| No trailing period       | It's a title, not a sentence                               |
| No emojis (Conventional) | Breaks parser tooling; emoji belongs in body if anywhere   |
| Skip filenames           | The diff already shows them — describe behavior, not paths |
| Be specific              | "Fix null deref in token refresh" beats "Fix bug"          |

**Body (always include one):**

- Explain **why**, not what — the diff shows what
- Wrap at ~72 chars, separate from subject with one blank line
- Two sentences is often enough; a few short paragraphs when warranted
- Mention load-bearing context: hidden constraints, related issues, what a future bisect would want
  to know
- **No uncertain language.** Banish "likely", "probably", "might", "seems", "appears to",
  "presumably". You wrote the code — state facts. If you don't know what a change does, read more
  before committing.

### Co-Authored-By

When an agent does meaningful work in a commit, add a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer with a descriptive
identity that names the model. This makes attribution legible across multi-agent sessions and
`git log`.

```
Co-Authored-By: Nova (Claude Opus 4.7) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Use a name that signals which model or persona contributed — not just "Claude".

### The HEREDOC pattern

Always pass commit messages via HEREDOC to preserve formatting and avoid shell-quoting bugs:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(auth): guard against null session in token refresh

Refresh requests racing with logout were dereferencing a freed session
pointer, surfacing as a 500 with no log trail. Added an early return
that emits a single warn log so the failure mode is visible without
spamming on every refresh attempt.

Co-Authored-By: Nova (Claude Opus 4.7) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Examples

| Bad                        | Why bad                 | Good                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `fix: bug`                 | Vague                   | `fix(api): resolve null pointer in token refresh` |
| `update stuff`             | No type, no specificity | `chore(deps): bump axios to 1.7.4`                |
| `WIP`                      | Not a commit message    | `feat(auth): scaffold magic-link sign-in flow`    |
| `Added new file for users` | Filename + past tense   | `feat(users): add bulk import endpoint`           |
| `feat: it works now`       | Doesn't say what works  | `feat(search): add fuzzy matching to user lookup` |

### Multi-agent hygiene

Other agents may be working in parallel. Stage with care:

```bash
git status                # See the full picture first
git diff --staged         # Review what you're about to commit
git add <specific-files>  # Only files you personally touched
git commit -m "..."       # HEREDOC for the message
```

| Rule                                           | Why                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Never `git add -A` or `git add .`              | Picks up other agents' WIP and secrets     |
| Never `git restore` files you didn't modify    | May discard another agent's in-flight work |
| Never `git push` unless explicitly asked       | Push is the human's call                   |
| Skip planning docs, scratch files, `.local.md` | These don't belong in the repo             |
| Verify before commit, not after                | A red commit poisons bisect history        |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                     | Fix                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Writing tests from memory                        | Read actual function signatures first           |
| Changing shared types without grepping consumers | `Grep` all usages before modifying shared types |
| Mixing move and change in one commit             | Move first commit, change second commit         |
| Debugging spiral past 3 attempts                 | Change approach or escalate                     |
| Premature optimization                           | Correctness first, optimize after tests pass    |
| One mega-commit at end of session                | Commit each logical chunk as it lands           |
| Bare titles like `fix: bug` or `update stuff`    | Specific subject + body explaining why          |
| Skipping the body to "save time"                 | Always include a body — even two sentences      |
| Filenames or paths in the subject line           | Describe the behavior, not the file             |
| Uncertain language ("might fix", "should work")  | State facts; read more code if you don't know   |
| `git add -A` / `git add .`                       | Stage specific files only                       |
| `git push` without explicit request              | Push is the human's call; never autonomous      |
| Silently picking one interpretation              | Surface options; ask before committing to one   |
| "Improving" code adjacent to your change         | Stay surgical; touch only what's asked          |
| Touching comments you don't understand           | Leave them; not your scope                      |
| Bloated abstraction for single-use code          | Write the function; abstract when reused        |
| Vague "make it work" goal                        | Define a verifiable check first                 |

## Cross-Model Review

For high-stakes changes, use `/hyperskills:codex-review` after implementation. A fresh model context
eliminates implementation bias and catches real bugs: migration idempotency, PII in debug logging,
empty array edge cases, missing batch limits.

## What This Skill is NOT

- **Not a gate.** Don't follow all five phases for a typo fix. Scale selection exists for a reason.
- **Not a replacement for reading code.** This skill tells you HOW to implement, not WHAT to
  implement.
- **Not a planning tool.** Use `/hyperskills:plan` for task decomposition.
- **Not an excuse to skip tests.** "Verify" means running actual checks, not eyeballing the diff.
