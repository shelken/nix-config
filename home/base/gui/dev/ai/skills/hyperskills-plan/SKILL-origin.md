# Structured Planning

Verification-driven task decomposition with Sibyl-native tracking. Mined from 200+ real planning
sessions — the plans that actually survived contact with code.

**Core insight:** Plans fail when steps can't be verified. Decompose until every step has a concrete
check. Track in Sibyl so plans survive context windows.

## The Process

```dot
digraph planning {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    "1. SCOPE" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];
    "2. EXPLORE" [style=filled, fillcolor="#ffe8e8"];
    "3. DECOMPOSE" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8ffe8"];
    "4. VERIFY & APPROVE" [style=filled, fillcolor="#fff8e0"];
    "5. TRACK" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];

    "1. SCOPE" -> "2. EXPLORE";
    "2. EXPLORE" -> "3. DECOMPOSE";
    "3. DECOMPOSE" -> "4. VERIFY & APPROVE";
    "4. VERIFY & APPROVE" -> "5. TRACK";
    "4. VERIFY & APPROVE" -> "3. DECOMPOSE" [label="gaps found", style=dashed];
}
```

## Phase 1: SCOPE

**Bound the work before exploring it.**

### Actions

1. **Search Sibyl** for related tasks, decisions, prior plans:

   ```
   sibyl search "<feature keywords>"
   sibyl task list -s todo
   ```

2. **Define success criteria** — what does "done" look like?
   - Measurable outcomes (tests pass, endpoint returns X, UI renders Y)
   - NOT vague goals ("improve performance" → "p95 latency < 200ms")

3. **Identify constraints:**
   - Files/modules that CAN'T change
   - Dependencies that must be respected
   - Timeline or budget considerations

4. **Classify complexity:**

   | Scale         | Description                | Planning Depth             |
   | ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
   | **Quick fix** | < 3 files, clear solution  | Skip to implementation     |
   | **Feature**   | 3-10 files, known patterns | Light plan (this skill)    |
   | **Epic**      | 10+ files, new patterns    | Full plan + orchestration  |
   | **Redesign**  | Architecture change        | Full plan + research first |

### Gate

If this is a **quick fix**, stop planning and go build. Planning a 5-minute fix is waste.

---

## Phase 2: EXPLORE

**Understand the codebase surface area before decomposing.**

### Actions

1. **Map the impact surface** — which files/modules will this touch?
   - Spawn an Explore agent if the scope is uncertain
   - Read the actual code, don't guess from file names

2. **Identify existing patterns:**
   - How does similar functionality work in this codebase?
   - What conventions exist? (naming, file structure, test patterns)

3. **Find the dependencies:**
   - What must exist before this can work?
   - What will break if we change X?

### Output

A mental model of the change surface:

> "This touches: [module A] (new endpoint), [module B] (type changes), [module C] (tests). Pattern
> follows [existing feature X]. Depends on [infrastructure Y] being available."

---

## Phase 3: DECOMPOSE

**Break work into verifiable steps. Every step must have a check.**

### The Verification Rule

**A step without a verification method is not a step — it's a hope.**

For each task, define:

| Field          | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **What**       | Specific implementation action  |
| **Files**      | Exact files to create/modify    |
| **Verify**     | How to confirm it works         |
| **Depends on** | Which tasks must complete first |

### Verification Methods

| Method        | When to Use                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `typecheck`   | Type changes, interface additions        |
| `test`        | Logic, edge cases, integrations          |
| `lint`        | Style, formatting, import order          |
| `build`       | Build system changes                     |
| `visual`      | UI changes (screenshot or browser check) |
| `curl/httpie` | API endpoint changes                     |
| `manual`      | Only when no automation exists           |

### Decomposition Heuristics

- **2-5 minute tasks** are the sweet spot. If a task takes > 15 minutes, break it further.
- **One concern per task.** "Add endpoint AND write tests" is two tasks.
- **Order by dependency, not difficulty.** Foundation first.
- **Mark parallelizable tasks.** Tasks with no shared files can run simultaneously.

### Task Format

```markdown
## Task [N]: [Imperative title]

**Files:** `src/path/file.ts`, `tests/path/file.test.ts` **Depends on:** Task [M] **Parallel:**
Yes/No (can run alongside Task [X])

### Implementation

[2-4 bullet points of what to do]

### Verify

- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
- [ ] `pnpm test -- file.test.ts` passes
- [ ] [specific assertion about behavior]
```

### Parallelizability Markers

Mark tasks that can run simultaneously for orchestration:

```
Wave 1 (foundation):  Task 1, Task 2  [parallel]
Wave 2 (core):        Task 3, Task 4  [parallel, depends on Wave 1]
Wave 3 (integration): Task 5          [sequential, depends on Wave 2]
Wave 4 (polish):      Task 6, Task 7  [parallel, depends on Wave 3]
```

---

## Phase 4: VERIFY & APPROVE

**Review the plan before executing it.**

### Self-Check

Before presenting to the user, verify:

- [ ] Every task has a verification method
- [ ] Dependencies form a DAG (no cycles)
- [ ] No two parallel tasks modify the same files
- [ ] Total scope matches the original success criteria
- [ ] Nothing is over-engineered (YAGNI check)

### Present for Approval

Show the plan as a structured list with waves:

```markdown
## Plan: [Feature Name]

**Success criteria:** [measurable outcome] **Estimated tasks:** [N] across [M] waves
**Parallelizable:** [X]% of tasks can run in parallel

### Wave 1: Foundation

- [ ] Task 1: [title] → verify: [method]
- [ ] Task 2: [title] → verify: [method]

### Wave 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Task 3: [title] → verify: [method] (depends: 1)
- [ ] Task 4: [title] → verify: [method] (depends: 2)

### Wave 3: Integration

- [ ] Task 5: [title] → verify: [method] (depends: 3, 4)
```

### Gap Analysis

After presenting, explicitly check:

- "Is there anything missing from this plan?"
- "Should any of these tasks be combined or split further?"
- "Are the success criteria right?"

---

## Phase 5: TRACK

**Register the plan in Sibyl for persistence.**

### Actions

1. **Create a Sibyl task** for the feature:

   ```
   sibyl task create --title "[Feature]" -d "[success criteria]" --complexity epic
   ```

2. **Create sub-tasks** for each plan step:

   ```
   sibyl task create --title "Task 1: [title]" -e [epic-id] -d "[implementation + verify]"
   ```

3. **Record the plan decision:**
   ```
   sibyl add "Plan: [feature]" "[N] tasks across [M] waves. Key decisions: [architectural choices]. Dependencies: [critical path]."
   ```

### Adaptive Replanning

Plans change when they meet reality. When a task reveals unexpected complexity:

1. **Don't force through.** Pause and reassess.
2. **Update the plan** — add/remove/modify tasks.
3. **Update Sibyl** — keep the tracking current.
4. **Communicate** — "Task 3 revealed [X]. Adjusting plan: [changes]."

---

## Execution Handoff

Once the plan is approved, hand off to the right tool:

| Situation                      | Handoff                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 3-5 simple tasks, user present | Execute directly with verification gates      |
| 5-15 tasks, mixed parallel     | `/hyperskills:orchestrate` with wave strategy |
| Large epic, 15+ tasks          | Orchestrate with Epic Parallel Build strategy |
| Needs more research first      | `/hyperskills:research` before executing      |

### Trust Gradient for Execution

| Phase             | Review Level                          | When                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Full ceremony** | Implement + spec review + code review | First 3-4 tasks                  |
| **Standard**      | Implement + spec review               | Tasks 5-8, patterns stabilized   |
| **Light**         | Implement + quick verify              | Late tasks, established patterns |

This is earned confidence, not cutting corners.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                           | Fix                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Planning a five-minute fix             | Build directly and verify                    |
| Tasks without verification             | Add a concrete check or split the task       |
| Parallel tasks touching the same files | Sequence them or repartition ownership       |
| Planning from filenames only           | Read the actual code path before decomposing |
| Treating the first plan as permanent   | Replan when reality reveals new constraints  |

## What This Skill is NOT

- **Not required for simple tasks.** If the solution is obvious, just build it.
- **Not a design doc generator.** Plans are action lists, not architecture documents.
- **Not a blocker.** If the user says "just start building," start building. You can plan in
  parallel.
- **Not rigid.** Plans adapt. The first plan is a hypothesis.
